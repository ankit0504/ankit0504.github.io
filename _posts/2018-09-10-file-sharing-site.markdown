This project is the first one on this website that was not created by only me. I worked on this project with a classmate of mine in our "Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming" class.<br>
It has simple functionality, but works similar to Dropbox. It is currently not password protected, but a user must enter a username to login to their dashboard and see their files. As a creative portion, we implemented the ability for a user to register themselves and also share their files with other users that have accounts on the website.<br>
We mainly used PHP to create the site. It is hosted on an EC2 Instance hosted through AWS. <br>
