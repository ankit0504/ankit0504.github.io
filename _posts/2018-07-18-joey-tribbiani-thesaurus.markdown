This project is the first time that I have ever created something for the public to use. This is a Google Chrome extension that allows the user to select some text on their screen and easily replace each word with a synonym.<br/>
I decided to make this extension because I wanted to try my hand at making a chrome extension; it seemed like the simplest way to publish something for public use. I also love finding fun chrome extensions, so I wanted to start contributing to the community and make one myself. I wasn't sure what I should make- everything I thought of already had a solution. I didn't want to duplicate anyone else's work, so I had to keep thinking. Around this same time, one of my mean friends called me a kangaroo, which reminded me of the scene in Friends where Joey uses a thesaurus on every word in a letter he was drafting.<br/>
