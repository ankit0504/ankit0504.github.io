Hi, my name is Ankit! I am a student in The School of Engineering & Applied Science at Washington University in St. Louis obtaining a degree in computer science. I am also working towards earning a second major in economics and a minor in mathematics, both from the school of Arts & Sciences.

I first became aware of computer science in fourth grade, when I attended a weekly program held by IBM in their Armonk, NY headquarters. In the program, IBM brought in their software developers every Saturday to teach us about the fundamentals of computer science. This program taught me what algorithms were, and how to implement them using Scratch. This program is responsible for my consistent interest in computer science throughout my childhood.

In the summer of 2019, I will be a software engineering intern at Square in San Francisco!

Last summer, I worked as an intern at [Crossbeam](https://parternbase.io), a startup in Philadelphia. Here, I got my first exposure to working with a software engineering team, and became proficient in JavaScript and Python. I worked alongside the two founders of the company and four other interns. This experience was extremely unique and allowed me to gain insights into the entire pipeline of a tech startup. I am extremely grateful to the founders of this company; they were extremely accessible, and acted as personal mentors to me. I learned about the entire development process, from developing code to deploying code, as well as the venture capital process, and how to structure investment deals.

During the school year, I work as a teaching assistant (TA) in various computer science courses. I previously TA'd for the introductory course, but am now a TA for Logic & Discrete Math, and Data Structures & Algorithms. Every week I help students work through assignments in a studio setting and I hold office hours outside of the classroom so students can receive additional help.
