I am a student in The School of Engineering & Applied Science at Washington University in St. Louis obtaining a degree in computer science. I am also working towards earning a second major in economics and a minor in mathematics, both from the school of Arts & Sciences.

I was born in the United Kingdom and moved to the White Plains, NY when I was just a few months old. Since then, I have become a fan of hockey, tennis, and cricket.

Last summer, I worked as an intern at [Crossbeam](https://www.getcrossbeam.com), a startup in Philadelphia. During the school year, I work as a teaching assistant (TA) in various computer science courses. I previously TA'd for the introductory course, but am now a TA for Logic & Discrete Math, and Data Structures & Algorithms.
